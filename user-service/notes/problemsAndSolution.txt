[ERROR] AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: ifError got unwanted exception: database "user_service" does not exist
    at module.exports 

HOW TO FIX:
1. Fix the Startup Order (Health Checks)
Even if the database exists, the user-service might fail if it tries to run migrations before PostgreSQL is ready to accept connections. Use a health check to ensure the database is fully "healthy" before the migration runs. 
docker-compose.yml:
yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres -d user_service"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

2. Clear old data and stop containers:
docker-compose down -v
3. Start only the database:
docker-compose up -d postgres
4. Wait 10 seconds (for Postgres to initialize the user_service DB).
5. Run migrations from your host machine:
npm run migrate
6. Start your Serverless app:
npm run dev
